# Gno Live Coding Session #1

#### Topic: Minimal Constant Product GRC20 AMM in Gno
#### Date: Friday, Aug 16th 2024
#### Presenter: [@leohhhn](https://github.com/leohhhn)

This live coding session was the first Gno Live coding session.
It included building a basic GRC20 DEX in Gno with the constant product AMM
algorithm. The base implementation only handles two GRC20 tokens:
[wugnot](https://gno.land/r/demo/wugnot) & [foo20](https://gno.land/r/demo/foo20).

## Following up

We encourage anyone who wishes to build upon the example given in the coding
session to do so. Please make a PR adding your code to the 
[`followup-work/`](./followup-work) folder, and ping the presenter.
